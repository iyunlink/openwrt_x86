Title: cni netifd protocol
Maintainer: Oskari Rauta <oskari.rauta@gmail.com>

Type: ipkg
Description:   protocol support for cni networks for netifd
  makes defining network for podman and other similar
  systems using cni networking much easier and simpler.

  with cni protocol support, on a network, where firewall
  and portmapper management is disabled, you may control
  firewalling with openwrt's default firewall configuration.

  for example, create a container that hosts web content on
  port 80 with static ip on your cni network, if your
  network is 10.88.0.0/16, use for eg. 10.88.0.101 as
  your containers static ip address. Create a zone, cni
  to your firewall and add your interface to it.

  Now you can easily set up redirectiong to 10.88.0.101:80
  to expose it's port 80 to wan for serving your website.

  Protocol has one setting: device, on podman this often
  is cni-podman0.
